# bot6-Telegram-Cash-Expenses-Tracker
I'm currently building a bot for tracking my cash expenses. <br>
Will publish the code here in the second half of April 2022. 

<h2>How the bot works:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enter manually your expense description and price, separated with a comma. Ex.: 'Bananas, 2'.</li>
<li>Select a predefined category of your expense: press one of the appeared buttons. Ex.: 'Grocery' button.</li>
<li>The bot saves your input as a new row in the budget table (Google Sheet).</li>
</ul>
