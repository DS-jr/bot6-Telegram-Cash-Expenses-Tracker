# bot6-Telegram-Cash-Expenses-Tracker
I'm currently building a bot for tracking my personal cash expenses & saving them to a budget table (Google Sheets). <br>
Will publish the code here in the second half of April 2022. 

<h2>How the bot works:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1. Enter manually your expense description and price, separated with a comma. Ex.: 'Bananas, 2'.</li>
<li>2. Select the predefined category of your expense: press one of the appeared buttons. Ex.: 'Grocery' button.</li>
<li>3. The bot saves this expense as a new row in your budget table (Google Sheet).</li>
</ul>
